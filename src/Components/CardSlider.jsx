            "What goes on in a mother’s mind when any time she visits the hospital with her son, she is informed that his cancer has relapsed? Having faced that situation thrice, I pray to God none of the parents ever have the ill fortune to witness their own child suffering from cancer from time and again. My family's happiness lies in Abir. Him being the youngest member of my family of four, all of us are accustomed to his joyous and playful. When he became extremely sick the first time, he was scared and sad. Yet he tried to cheer all of us up as much as he could.",
            "What my son has been going through for years is awful. But we have had the opportunity to at least seek treatment for him. We understand thousands of little children are going through exactly the same, and possibly worse, than Abir. Hence, all contributions after funding the treatment cost will be used to fund cancer research and to launch a digital platform to support and empower Indian families and children suffering from cancer by bringing together 1000s of survivors, cancer doctors and experts, insurance companies, and a network of supporters to create a resilient ecosystem to beat cancer together.",

In normal times, 4,000 diverse students from southern Rajasthan’s lowest income households study on a 600-acre campus with sports grounds, libraries, laboratories and opportunities for art, craft and the exploration of nature. (At present, due to Covid-19, learning is offered online). This rounded learning, combined with a commitment to peace and tolerance, makes Vidya Bhawan students responsible and civic-minded.
